# AF_ALG wrapper for Haskell

## DISCLAIMER: THIS is WIP

The haskell files in this directory provide a basic wrapper for the AF_ALG linux kernel crypto api.

* the .hsc files contain the interface wrappers/definitions
* the .hs files are a first attempt to make sense of the api with types.

### What doesn't work yet
* AEAD still needs some work


# USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
I made this for a private project I currently put on hold until an unknown time. I release this for study only!

I did this release for [this project](https://github.com/raaz-crypto/raaz/blob/master/LICENSE). So I will put the same LICENSE.
IF you want to include it with another license, feel free to send me a message.
